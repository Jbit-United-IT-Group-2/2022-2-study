Let's get some practice with HTML Images and Anchor Elements.  In `index.html`, please do the following:

* Create a link that goes to this url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf Use whatever link text you would like!

* Create an image element using this source: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Kolm%C3%A5rden_Wolf.jpg

* Make sure to include some alt text on the image!
