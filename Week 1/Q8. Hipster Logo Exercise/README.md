# Hipster Logo Exercise
I'm opening up a very hip artisanal vodka company called Purple Grain. Please help complete my incredibly ugly logo. Style the `<h1>` with the following styles:

* uppercase all the letters, without touching the html! (note: you weren't taught how to do this, you will need to flex your googling skills)

* set the font-family to be 'monospace'

* center align the text

* set the font weight to 100

* make the text size 40px

* set spacing between letters to 20px

* add a wavy plum underline (plum is the color) - I can't test this, but make sure it looks like the image!
